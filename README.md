# Glass Classifications

In this report, I built and evaluated three classification models (Random Forest, k-NN, and GBM) to classify glass types as forensic evidence. I also assessed model performance using cross-validation, confusion matrices, error rates to select the most interpretable and accurate model. My goal was to balance predictive accuracy with explainability for legal applications.
